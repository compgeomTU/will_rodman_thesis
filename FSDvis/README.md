# Graph By Curve Free Space Diagram
## Traversal Distance Python Library Visualizer

### Installation
Download zip package and dependencies from GitHub.

### Dependencies
* [NumPy](numpy.org) is used to calculate dimensions of free space diagrams.
* Free space diagrams are stored using [Shapleys](shapely.readthedocs.io)
Polygon and Multipolygon classes.
* The GUI of the free space diagram is built using [matplotlib](matplotlib.org).

### Command Line
To run the program, run a command line execution in the package with format:
```
python3 main.py <graph filename: str> <curve filename: str>
```

**Flags:**
* `-e` type: *float* | specifies the Epsilon value for the free space diagram.

* `-n` type: *int* | number of area approximation terms (Δ) of each cells free space.

* `-f` type: *str* | saves plot as a type of file.

* `-l` type: *str* logged computation of Traversal Distance and free space
diagram as a .log file.

* `-a` type: *float* given Epsilon, prints the area of the free space diagram.

* `-p` plots graph and curve in 2D.


### Sample Inputs
Sample graph and curve files can be copied and pasted into the command line.

1. samples/A samples/B
2. samples/H samples/G
3. samples/P samples/Q
4. samples/arc_de_triomphe samples/vehicle_path

### Example of 3D Free Space Diagram
This image shows the Arc de Triomphe is Paris, France. It is surrounded by
twelve intersecting roads and one pedestrian tunnel.

Given a roadmap, we can build the road network surrounding the monument
and a path for any given vehicle.
```
python3 main.py samples/arc_de_triomphe samples/vehicle_path -f docs/arc_de_triomphe_.png
```
**arc_de_triomphe_freespace.png:**
![Image](/docs/arc_de_triomphe_graph.png?raw=true)

In this plot, the road network is defined as a graph (colored black) and the
vehicle path is defined as a curve (colored dashed gray). By computing the
Traversal Distance of the graph and curve, we can visualize the free space
diagram is 3D space.  
```
python3 main.py samples/arc_de_triomphe samples/vehicle_path -e 5.0 -f docs/arc_de_triomphe_graphpng
```
**arc_de_triomphe.png:**

The free space is shown where epsilon equals five.

### Example of N Approximations of Free Space
To approximate the smoothness of the an elliptical free space diagram, compute
the Traversal Distance on a set of sub divided edges from each edge of a curve and
graph.
```
python3 main.py samples/P samples/Q -e 5.0 -n 5
```
**n_approximation_0.png:**
![Image](/docs/n_approximation_0.png?raw=true)
The free space shown has no approximation, the following free space shown has
an approximation of 5.
**n_approximation_5.png:**
![Image](/docs/n_approximation_5.png?raw=true)
When the number of approximations increases in the following free space from 5 to
50, the curvature of the free space becomes smoother.

### Example of Logging Traversal Distance Computations
To Save the data generated by the Traversal Distance and free space diagram,
create a log as the program runs.  
```
python3 main.py samples/P samples/Q -e 5.0 -n 50
```
